This blog is my attempt to get past what I feel many developers struggle with. I would like to be able to just dive into things more easily even though I may not know the best approach.  Is it vital to research some things before starting work? Absolutely. I think the type of personality that development tends to attract, have no problem with doing this naturally. The initial momentum is sometimes worth just jumping into it, even if you have no idea what you are doing. Even if you look like an idiot or have to start over, the two most important things are that **you started** and, horror, **you learn something**. Looking like you don't know what you are doing is a small price to pay for learning how to do it. Wasting time having to rewrite something is not wasting time if you learned the right way to do it. The rest of this article is going to be about specific example of what some developers, myself included, need to just start doing!

## Open Source Projects

> "I need to clean it up a little first."

I can't tell you how many times I've heard some variant of this when asking why doesn't a newer developer open source a project or why their Github is so empty. Just upload it. If you think it is messy or you are embarrassed of the code, one of three things will happen. 

1. Nobody will see it or care
1. It will help a developer even newer than you
1. Someone will come, fork your work, and clean it up for you.

No matter what happens, you will not die and your career won't be ruined. I am very guilty of being trapped in this thought pattern myself, as much as my personal beliefs make me think information should be freely shared between everyone. My advice for getting over this will be to just upload the repository *without* bothering to "clean it up" or even have it be functional yet. It will just increase your motivation to work on said project once it is visible to everyone.
