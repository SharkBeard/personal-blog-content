## Episode IV: A new beginning...

I had been meaning to create a personal site with a blog for years now. I have a few topics I'd been wanting to write about and post somewhere. For one reason or another, I have been procrastinating on actually making a personal site until I finally came to the realization that it shouldn't keep me from writing content. I think that people should get to writing content while the inspiration is there and worry about the technical implimentation later. The ultimate seperation of concerns.

## Just do it!

I have decided to just start by creating markdown files in a git repository as my starting point. At least people can see them on Github for now. Down the road, I can add them to a static site generator and host them somewhere. I am currently looking at [Jekyll](http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Ruhoh](http://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb). I like those two because I am currently Ruby biased and they both support Markdown. Jekyll has the added bonus of supporting Haml, which I am familiar with. I like the synergy I can get with this and I can keep up to date with my blog using just the command-line and using simple markdown. 

Sidenote: If you are viewing this on github, the table above is meant for a static site generator. Most of the Jekyll-compatable static site generators have some sort of ability to read metadata from the post as yaml. 

The intention of this blog is to document the path I took in my career, so newer programmers can see the gradual steps that it takes to get good at the craft. I also want to just share my knowledge with my friends and anyone who stumbles upon this. Since starting my new position at @lease-on-demand, I seem to be going into overdrive with learning new tools and techniques, especially when teaching newer programmers. I may also put some non-programming things on here, as the need arises.

Things I am currently working with a lot and you can expect posts about:

* Static site generation
* Ruby on Rails
* Sidekiq
* Heroku
* AWS
* Trailblazer operations

## About me

I suppose I should put something about myself as this is my first post.

I am a young man who has been developing professionally since graduating college in 2011. I studied Computer Science and Engineering desiring to experience all different types of development. In my initial career, I did a lot of short term contract work, much of which was from home. Early on I enjoyed the freedom, flexibilty and excitement that it offered. After a while, stabilty and a steady amount of tasks became more important. I've worked with mostly Ruby, PHP and js thus far in my career, but I love expanding my horizons.
